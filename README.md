# Digital Clock using Python and Tkinter

This project is a simple digital clock built using Python and the Tkinter library. The clock displays the current time (Hours, Minutes, and Seconds) and updates every second.

## Features

- Displays the current time in **HH:MM:SS** format.
- Automatically updates every second.
- Styled with custom colors and fonts for a modern, clean look.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **GUI Framework**: Tkinter (used for creating the graphical user interface)
- **Time Module**: Built-in Python module used to fetch the current system time.
- **Tkinter Labels**: Used to display the clock and other text.

## Project Structure

- `clock.py`: Main Python script containing the code for the digital clock.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python)

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the `clock.py` file using the following command:
